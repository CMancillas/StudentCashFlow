Here's your financial summary:

Good news! Your finances are looking stable for now. Starting with $5,000 MXN, you'll end with $3,492 MXN after all payments, which keeps you well above your minimum buffer of $1,000 MXN. 🌟

I notice a few things about your upcoming bills:
1. You have two identical electricity bills ($1,200 MXN each) scheduled for the same day (Nov 13). This might be a duplicate entry you'll want to check! 🔍

Here are my specific recommendations:

1. **Check for Duplicates:**
   * Verify if the two electricity bills (CFE) are actually duplicates. If so, removing one would save you $1,200 MXN! 

2. **Bill Management:**
   * Your utility bills (electricity, water, internet) are all clustered between Nov 13-15
   * Consider calling your providers to spread these payment dates throughout the month
   * This would give you better cash flow management

3. **Savings Opportunities:**
   * Your phone bill ($350 MXN) seems reasonable, but you could:
     - Check if your carrier offers student discounts
     - Compare with other carriers' plans
   * For electricity ($1,200 MXN), try:
     - Using natural light during day
     - Unplugging devices when not in use
     - Using fans instead of AC when possible

4. **Future Planning:**
   * Consider setting aside about $3,500 MXN
